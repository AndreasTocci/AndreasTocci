# Hi, I am Andreas Tocci 

## About Me
As an aspiring Data Analyst, I bring a unique blend of analytical skills, phenomenal 
communication and presentational skills and great hunger to learn and develop. My 
background in Hospitality and Sales have helped me gain essential skills such as 
dealing with KPI’s, understanding and anticipating customer needs and expectations, 
whilst being able to think critically and execute quickly and efficiently in line with deadlines. 
This has also taught me how to present myself and the material, in adaptation to whom it is presented 
to and with great confidence. My passion for analytics has stemmed from a love of 
problem solving, and the drive to become better, and in doing this I want to help businesses 
and organizations create effective and strong insights to execute better data-driven 
solutions. 
I am proficient in SQL, Python, Tableau, Microsoft Excel and office. I have undertaken 
and executed numerous projects. I aim to make a difference. I have elderly parents, and 
with the increase in age, health risks are ever more present. I want to use my analytical 
skills to aid this cause and help not just my parents but millions of people around the 
world suffering from all sorts of conditions and helping businesses and trained 
professionals to aid, prevent and cure, giving us all a fighting chance. 
But this is not all, my drive to decipher big data, and my plethora of transferable skills 
and knowledge makes me a good fit to any team. Aiming to help all sorts of business 
and organizations to understand and generate actionable insights to drive innovation, 
decipher the unknown, and achieve greatness.
